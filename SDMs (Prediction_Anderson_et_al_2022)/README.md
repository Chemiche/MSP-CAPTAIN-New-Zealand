Habitat suitability models for the genera *Bathypathes*, *Enallopsimia*, *Errina*, *Goniocorella*, *Madrepora*, *Paragorgia*, *Solenosmilia* and *Stylaster* 

These models include:

Left. The Original taxon distribution model for each genera obtained from the DOC marine portal. Left centre. The neural network predicted map made by CAPTAIN for the present distribution for each genera based on temperature, dissolved oxygen, and bathymetry layers. Right-centre.  The future distribution map for each genera made using CAPTAIN with temperature and dissolved oxygen data layers, and the static bathymetry layer (1995-2014, climate scenario: SSP2-4.5). Right. The future distribution map for each genera obtained from Anderson et al. (2022) (2080-2099, climate scenario: SSP2-4.5). Yellow represents suitable habitat areas and dark blue represents unsuitable habitat areas.
